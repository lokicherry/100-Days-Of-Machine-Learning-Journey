# My-100-Days-Of-Machine-Learning

## Day - 1

* Learned basics of python in kaggle python course
* Completed chapter-1 in Machine Learning book
* Got idea about different types of machine learning systems

Supervised vs Unsupervised learning

Reinforcement Learning

Batch and Online Learning

Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning

* Implemented Linear Regression

import model from sklearn
``import sklearn.linear_model``

Load model into a variable ``model = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()``

Fit the model using ``model.fit(X,y)`` Here   `X` is feature and `y` is the value we are trying to predict. 

Then predict for a new value of X using ``model.predict(X_new)``
